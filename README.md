# HTML-CSS-Git-Refactor
Week 1 homework assignment: refactor this webpage for accessibility and search engine optimization.

## User Story
As a marketing agency, the user wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a webpage meets accessibility standards,
* The source code contains semantic HTML elements
* The HTML is structured logically, independent of style and positioning
* Images have accessible alt attributes
* Headings fall in sequential order
* The title is concise and descriptive

## Procedure
I've replaced generic elements with semantic elements, consolidated repetitive code, reorganized and commented for ease of access, and added any requirements for accessibility throughout the page.
